# STACK OPERATIONS
- Create Stack
- Push
- Pop
- Peek
- isEmpty
- isFull
- deleteStack

# Differences in stack creation by Arrays and Linked List
- **Array**
- - Easy to implement
- - Fixed size
- 
- **CREATION**
- - time complexity: O(1)
- - space complexity: O(N)  --> size inputted
- **ISEMPTY**,  **ISFULL**, **PUSH**, **POP**, **PEEK**, **DELETE**
- - time complexity: O(1)
- - space complexity: O(1)


- Linked List
- - variable size
- - implementation is not easy (more code)
